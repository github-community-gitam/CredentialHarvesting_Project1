# Credentials_Harvesting_Poject1-
Credential harvesting is the immediate goal of most cybercrime in which attackers seek usersâ€™ login information. 

**Aim Of The Project** : Mimic a Credential Harvesting attack 
 

**Credential Harvesting** 
It is a Cyberattack method where attackers attempt to steal sensitive login credentials, such as usernames and passwords, from unsuspecting individuals or systems. 

This is  a significant threat to an individual or an organization. There will be huge financial loss and trust between the company and the end users of products or services, which will often form the first  step in larger cyberattacks like data breaches, identity theft, or system intrusions.

There are several techniques in Credential Harvesting Works. 
1. Phishing Attacks: The attacker acts as a legitimate entity. These typically trick victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages.
2. Keyloggers:  Malicious software is installed on a victim's device to capture keystrokes, recording every password or sensitive information typed.
3. Man-in-the-Middle(MitM) Attack: Cybercriminals intercept communications between a user and a legitimate system, capturing credentials during transmission.
4. Social Engineering: The attacker manipulates victims into voluntarily sharing their credentials by exploiting trust or ignorance.
5. Malicious Apps or Software: Some programs are disguised as legitimate but are designed to steal saved credentials from browsers or password managers.
6. Dumpster Diving: Physical methods such as searching discarded documents, which may contain sensitive info.


From the Above techniques, We Use Credential Harvesting By Phishing attacks. 

Use deceptive techniques to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data. It is one of the most common and effective forms of social engineering.
By Capture (Data Theft ): 
The victim either enters sensitive information on a fake website controlled by the attacker or downloads malware that harvests their data.

First, you'll need to set up all the required software to do the attack.
Second, The Attack Fun part.
