**Caution: For Educational and testing purposes only** 

After installing the virtual box and Kali Linux virtual machine in the Virtual Box 

We use this Linux machine to perform attacks. Now the Credential Harvesting attack 

## Starting the virtual machine

## logging in as user: kali and password: kali

## Opening the CLI command line interface or terminal 
![[Pasted image 20241127023526.png]]

switching to a super user : 
A super user or a sudo user refers to a user with higher privileges than a usual user that is an admin user having admin level access or also referred as the root user

![[Pasted image 20241127023820.png]]
The password is Kali Note: do not worry u can't see the password while typing 
![[Pasted image 20241127023913.png]]

We can see that we have changed to a root user

 In order to do the attack, we need a tool called Zphisher. 

## Cloning Zphisher tool 

 https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git
Using this URL to clone the tool

## Changing to the cloned directory that is phisher by following commands 
cd phisher

## Running the Zphisher tool 

Has it is a tool which is generally written in bash scripting 
we need to use the following command 
./zphisher.sh which is their in the zphisher

Choosing required options for this attack i am using Instagram fake login page 

![[Pasted image 20241127144421.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241127144447.png]]

Upon accessing the url given 

![[Pasted image 20241127144538.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241127144550.png]]


The victim will enter the credentials

![[Pasted image 20241127144710.png]]![[Pasted image 20241127144723.png]]

we can get the victims credentials 
In this way an attacker creates a fake login page which acts as an legitimate by masking the url 

We can see the credentials in the saves files **auth/usernames.dat** and Victim's IP in **auth/ip.txt** 

![[Pasted image 20241127144938.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241127144955.png]]

Upon viewing both the files ip.txt and username.dat 

![[Pasted image 20241127145155.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241127145214.png]]

In this way we can perform the credential harvesting attacks 
we can select any option from the below options from 01-33

![[Pasted image 20241127144321.png]]


## Github 



Attacking using Github by selecting 33 option which is for Github 
I am here slecting option 02 for attacking a remote system 01 which is localhost

![[Pasted image 20241127150214.png]]

Upon visting the url

The credentials

This is the Project of credentials harvesting were we host a fake login page and gain the credentials thanks to zphisher tool. 

## Preventive measures to be taken against this type of attack 

1. Using 2FA methods Multi factor authentication methods
2. Not directly clicking unknown url's without checking them we can see a url where it is redirecting us by adding a '+' at the end of the url.
3. Training and educating awareness about these type of attacks in organizations. 
4. Securing Your connections 
5. Using Network segmentation.
